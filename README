Hello there, 

This is an HTML5 bundle for TextMate. You should use it like you would use the standard HTML bundle, except append a '5' after each command before hitting tab. 

	Example: doctype5 + TAB

If you have any questions or comments feel free to contact me.

This is build on the work of:
	design@jpmcgarrity.com

Enjoy,
